For example, a confusion matrix could reveal that a model trained to recognize handwritten digits tends to mistakenly predict 9 instead of 4, or 1 instead of 7. Confusion matrices contain sufficient information to calculate a variety of performance metrics, including precision and recall.

In other words, equality of opportunity measures whether the people who should qualify for an opportunity are equally likely to do so regardless of their group membership. For example, suppose Glubbdubdrib University admits both Lilliputians and Brobdingnagians to a rigorous mathematics program. Lilliputians’ secondary schools offer a robust curriculum of math classes, and the vast majority of students are qualified for the university program. Brobdingnagians’ secondary schools don’t offer math classes at all, and as a result, far fewer of their students are qualified. Equality of opportunity is satisfied for the preferred label of “admitted” with respect to nationality (Lilliputian or Brobdingnagian) if qualified students are equally likely to be admitted irrespective of whether they’re a Lilliputian or a Brobdingnagian. For example, let’s say 100 Lilliputians and 100 Brobdingnagians apply to Glubbdubdrib University, and admissions decisions are made as follows: Table 1. Lilliputian applicants (90% are qualified) Qualified Unqualified Admitted 45 3 Rejected 45 7 Total 90 10 Percentage of qualified students admitted: 45/90 = 50% Percentage of unqualified students rejected: 7/10 = 70% Total percentage of Lilliputian students admitted: (45+3)/100 = 48% Table 2. Brobdingnagian applicants (10% are qualified): Qualified Unqualified Admitted 5 9 Rejected 5 81 Total 10 90 Percentage of qualified students admitted: 5/10 = 50% Percentage of unqualified students rejected: 81/90 = 90% Total percentage of Brobdingnagian students admitted: (5+9)/100 = 14% The preceding examples satisfy equality of opportunity for acceptance of qualified students because qualified Lilliputians and Brobdingnagians both have a 50% chance of being admitted. Note: While equality of opportunity is satisfied, the following two fairness metrics are not satisfied:demographic parity: Lilliputians and Brobdingnagians are admitted to the university at different rates; 48% of Lilliputians students are admitted, but only 14% of Brobdingnagian students are admitted.equalized odds: While qualified Lilliputian and Brobdingnagian students both have the same chance of being admitted, the additional constraint that unqualified Lilliputians and Brobdingnagians both have the same chance of being rejected is not satisfied. Unqualified Lilliputians have a 70% rejection rate, whereas unqualified Brobdingnagians have a 90% rejection rate. See “Equality of Opportunity in Supervised Learning” for a more detailed discussion of equality of opportunity.

Equalized odds is satisfied provided that no matter whether an applicant is a Lilliputian or a Brobdingnagian, if they are qualified, they are equally as likely to get admitted to the program, and if they are not qualified, they are equally as likely to get rejected. Let’s say 100 Lilliputians and 100 Brobdingnagians apply to Glubbdubdrib University, and admissions decisions are made as follows: Table 3.

A linear model uses the following formula: y′=b+w1x1+w2x2+…wnxn where: y′ is the raw prediction. (In certain kinds of linear models, this raw prediction will be further modified. For example, see logistic regression.) b is the bias. w is a weight, so w1 is the weight of the first feature, w2 is the weight of the second feature, and so on. x is a feature, so x1 is the value of the first feature, x2 is the value of the second feature, and so on. For example, suppose a linear model for three features learns the following bias and weights: b = 7 w1 = -2.5 w2 = -1.2 w3 = 1.4 Therefore, given three features (x1, x2, and x3), the linear model uses the following equation to generate each prediction: y′=7+(−2.5)(x1)+(−1.2)(x2)+(1.4)(x3) Suppose a particular example contains the following values: x1 = 4 x2 = -10 x3 = 5 Plugging those values into the formula yields a prediction for this example: y′=7+(−2.5)(4)+(−1.2)(−10)+(1.4)(5) y′=16 Linear models tend to be easier to analyze and train than deep models. However, deep models can model complex relationships between features. Linear regression and logistic regression are two types of linear models.

As a value to be compared against a classification threshold . If the value is equal to or above the classification threshold, the system classifies the example as the positive class. Conversely, if the value is below the given threshold, the system classifies the example as the negative class .

In recommendation systems, the target matrix often holds users' ratings on items. For example, the target matrix for a movie recommendation system might look something like the following, where the positive integers are user ratings and 0 means that the user didn’t rate the movie: Casablanca The Philadelphia Story Black Panther Wonder Woman Pulp Fiction User 1 5.0 3.0 0.0 2.0 0.0 User 2 4.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 5.0 User 3 3.0 1.0 4.0 5.0 0.0 The movie recommendation system aims to predict user ratings for unrated movies. For example, will User 1 like Black Panther? One approach for recommendation systems is to use matrix factorization to generate the following two matrices: A user matrix, shaped as the number of users X the number of embedding dimensions. An item matrix, shaped as the number of embedding dimensions X the number of items. For example, using matrix factorization on our three users and five items could yield the following user matrix and item matrix: User Matrix Item Matrix 1.1 2.3 0.9 0.2 1.4 2.0 1.2 0.6 2.0 1.7 1.2 1.2 -0.1 2.1 2.5 0.5 The dot product of the user matrix and item matrix yields a recommendation matrix that contains not only the original user ratings but also predictions for the movies that each user hasn’t seen. For example, consider User 1’s rating of Casablanca, which was 5.0.

For example, suppose the pooling operation divides the convolutional matrix into 2x2 slices with a 1x1 stride. As the following diagram illustrates, four pooling operations take place. Imagine that each pooling operation picks the maximum value of the four in that slice: Pooling helps enforce translational invariance in the input matrix. Pooling for vision applications is known more formally as spatial pooling. Time-series applications usually refer to pooling as temporal pooling.

Self-attention is one of the main building blocks for Transformers and uses dictionary lookup terminology, such as “query”, “key”, and “value”. A self-attention layer starts with a sequence of input representations, one for each word. The input representation for a word can be a simple embedding. For each word in an input sequence, the network scores the relevance of the word to every element in the whole sequence of words. The relevance scores determine how much the word’s final representation incorporates the representations of other words. For example, consider the following sentence: The animal didn’t cross the street because it was too tired. The following illustration (from Transformer: A Novel Neural Network Architecture for Language Understanding) shows a self-attention layer’s attention pattern for the pronoun it, with the darkness of each line indicating how much each word contributes to the representation: The self-attention layer highlights words that are relevant to “it”. In this case, the attention layer has learned to highlight words that it might refer to, assigning the highest weight to animal.

The most common use of unsupervised machine learning is to cluster data into groups of similar examples. For example, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm can cluster songs together based on various properties of the music. The resulting clusters can become an input to other machine learning algorithms (for example, to a music recommendation service). Clustering can be helpful in domains where true labels are hard to obtain. For example, in domains such as anti-abuse and fraud, clusters can help humans better understand the data. Another example of unsupervised machine learning is principal component analysis (PCA). For example, applying PCA on a dataset containing the contents of millions of shopping carts might reveal that shopping carts containing lemons frequently also contain antacids.

Customers worldwide are crazy about this new design. While before that, it is this revolutional form of factory, that almost killed the unrevealed project. 2007 iPhone launch event\" 2007 iPhone launch event If it is not for this technology, there won’t be the first generation of iPhone. A flagships comparison in 2007\" A flagships comparison in 2007 I’m not talking about the multi-touch technology that Steve Jobs took efforts to introduce in the representation. Actually that technology is not invented by apple, it was a product made by a small company called finger work, this multi-touch technology was so successful that it brought the attention of apple engineers in their secret project. So Steven Jobs bought the whole company to acquire this Technology , putting multi-touch into its own inventory. This is another interesting topic but our focus today. FingerWorks product\" FingerWorks product So before the launch of the first generation iPhone , Steve Jobs has spent billions in his top-secret phone project called “project purple”. Steve Jobs assigned two different teams to this endeavor , representing two different directions, one is to grow the iPod into a phone, the other is to shrink the Mac into a iPhone. Two teams went their different ways without knowing what the other team was doing. iPod\" iPod In the beginning of 2006, Steve Jobs has decided that project purple should focus on the direction of putting Mac OS into a compact phone device. The later iPhone os, which was a version of macOS X , was getting its shape. Less than a year to the launch event, the software team till struggles in the design of the keyboard. Steve Jobs visions iPhone to be drastically different from all the other phones in the past, it doesn’t need a plastic keyboard which covers half of the front face, there will be a whole glass of screen with no obstacles. The keyboard appears when it is needed, and it can have different function keys based on different applications. iPhone original designs\" iPhone original designs This is absolutely out-of-box thinking for people back in 2006. But it was never easy to design such a virtual keyboard. What Steve Jobs wanted was a phone with a small factory, actually he never really like the idea of making a big screen phone. Before that, apple engineers have made the conclusion that the optimal size of a icon on a touch screen is actually 57 by 57 pixels. If we want to stack a full-sized virtual keyboard into such a small screen, the keys would be too small to avoid error triggers. This problem hinders the progress of this new project, even challenges the fundamental idea of iPhone. At that time, what people want was a portable phone, small enough to put into their jacket pockets, leading companies make T9 keyboard for their flagships. Things are too good to be true, if apple couldn’t handle text input smoothly, never to say all the other smart functions, Apple, then a computer company sets foot on the phone industry, if cannot guarantees the basic text experience of a phone, would become a joke of the tech community. Steve Jobs and his team\" Steve Jobs and his team There is no one else who could be more into user experience than Steve Jobs, blackbarry at that time features a full-sized physical keyboard and became popular among high-end users. He ordered the whole team to stop what they were doing, and shift their focus on making a good enough virtual keyboard.
